#Sentiment Analysis Project

Overview
This repository contains a Sentiment Analysis project developed as part of an internship task. The project focuses on analyzing text data to determine the sentiment expressed (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral) using machine learning or natural language processing techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and visualization of results.
Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis.
Sentiment Classification: Implementation of a model (e.g., using libraries like NLTK, TextBlob, or scikit-learn) to classify sentiments.
Visualization: Graphs or charts to represent sentiment distribution.
Code Documentation: Well-commented code for easy understanding.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:

Pandas (for data handling)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
NLTK/TextBlob or scikit-learn (for sentiment analysis)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualizations)


Environment: Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts
